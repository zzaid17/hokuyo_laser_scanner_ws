This repo is a ROS 2 package for a Hokuyo UST-20XL laser scanner that allows for processing laser scanner data and using it for mapping and navigation with a humanoid autonomous robot. Currently, static transforms for the scanner need to be updated to reflect real-life robot measurements. When mapping is complete, the ROS 2 navigation2 stack will be implemented.
